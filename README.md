ðŸ“š Libft

Recreating the Standard C Library, One Function at a Time!

Libft is a 42 School project where I built my own C library from scratch, implementing essential functions commonly found in <string.h>, <stdlib.h>, and <ctype.h>. This library became the foundation for many future projects, including printf and get_next_line.

ðŸ”¹ Key concepts learned:
	â€¢	Memory management (malloc, free, memcpy, memset, etc.)
	â€¢	String manipulation (strlen, strcpy, strdup, strjoin, etc.)
	â€¢	Character checks (isalpha, isdigit, toupper, etc.)
	â€¢	Modular and reusable code design

This project strengthened my understanding of C fundamentals and gave me a solid base for writing efficient, reusable code. ðŸš€
